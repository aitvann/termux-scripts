# Termux Scripts

A collection of termux scripts to be used with
[Termux:Widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget)

## Usage

Manually fill files in `secrets` directory because I don't feel like setting up
[git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) and
[OckAgent](https://github.com/DDoSolitary/OkcAgent) if it's going to work at all.
